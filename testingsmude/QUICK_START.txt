SMUDE TESTING ENVIRONMENT - QUICK START
========================================

SUCCESS! Your smude testing environment is ready to use.

WHAT'S BEEN SET UP:
-------------------
✓ Cloned smude repository from GitHub
✓ Created Python virtual environment
✓ Installed smude and all dependencies
✓ Downloaded the 348 MB deep learning model
✓ Created test folders and test script
✓ Added example sheet music image
✓ Verified everything works with a test run

FOLDER STRUCTURE:
-----------------
testingsmude/
├── test_images/         ← PUT YOUR IMAGES HERE
├── output_images/       ← RESULTS APPEAR HERE
├── test_smude.py        ← MAIN TEST SCRIPT
├── smude/              (source repository)
├── venv/               (Python environment)
└── README.md           (full documentation)

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Add your sheet music photos to test_images/
2. Run: cd testingsmude && source venv/bin/activate && python test_smude.py
3. Check output_images/ for dewarped results

EXAMPLE ALREADY RUN:
--------------------
✓ test_images/example_sheet_music.jpg (original curved photo)
✓ output_images/dewarped_example_sheet_music.png (straightened result)

COMMAND LINE USAGE:
-------------------
For single images:
  source venv/bin/activate
  smude test_images/myimage.jpg -o output_images/result.png

Options:
  --no-binarization    Keep grayscale instead of black/white
  --use-gpu           Use GPU for faster processing

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
----------------------
• Capture the full page with extra margins
• Use even lighting (no shadows)
• Keep images sharp and in focus
• Works best with cylindrical curves (bound books)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Test with your own sheet music images
2. Evaluate the quality of the dewarping
3. If you like it, let me know and I'll integrate it into your pipeline
